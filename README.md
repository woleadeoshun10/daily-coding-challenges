# My Coding Challenges

Just a bunch of daily coding challenges I’m working on to get better with loops, ifs, and all that beginner stuff. Doing these in Python and C++ to level up my coding skills bit by bit.

> **Note:** These solutions might not always be the most optimal — I’m focusing on learning and improving step by step!
