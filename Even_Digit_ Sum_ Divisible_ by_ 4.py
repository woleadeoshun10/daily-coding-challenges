ðŸ§  Challenge: Multiply Even Digit Sum
Problem Statement:
Print numbers from 1 to 250 where the sum of even digits in the number is divisible by 4.
Your Task:

Print only those numbers where the sum of even digits (like 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) is divisible by 4.
Print 5 numbers per line.
At the end, print the total count and the sum of all valid numbers.
