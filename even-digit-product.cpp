/* 
ðŸ”¹ Challenge Title:
Count and Sum All Numbers Between 1â€“200 Where the Product of Digits Is Even

ðŸ”¹ Instructions:
Loop through numbers from 1 to 200.
For each number, calculate the product of its digits.
If the product is even, print the number.
Also, keep track of:
The count of such numbers
The sum of such numbers
Print 5 numbers per line.
At the end, display the total count and sum.
